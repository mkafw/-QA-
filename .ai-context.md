# QA-OS Neural Context
> This file acts as the central synchronization point for Human-AI collaboration.

## 1. Project Identity
- **Name**: QA-OS (Helix Edition)
- **Core Metaphor**: DNA Double Helix (Cognition + Action).
- **Aesthetic**: Cosmic Glass (Deep Void, Apple-style Glass, Nebular Glows).
- **Status**: Alpha - **Phase: Biological Evolution**.

## 2. Active Configuration
- **Architecture**: DDD-Lite (View -> Hook -> Service -> Repository).
- **Framework**: React 18 + Tailwind CSS.
- **Visualization**: D3.js (System-Based Architecture: Scene/Node/Structure).
- **Data**: Dual-Mode (Memory/Supabase) + SeekDB (Architecture Ready).

## 3. Iteration Log
- **Current Hash**: bio-evo-v1 (Iteration 10)
- **Focus**: Injecting Thermodynamic Laws.
- **Recent Changes**:
  - [x] **Resistance**: QA Input requires "Cognitive Cost" (Links) to save.
  - [x] **Entropy**: Nodes decay visually over time (Opacity reduction).
  - [x] **Crystallization**: Completed OKR nodes and their children glow permanently.
  - [x] **Dark Matter**: Visualized structural holes in the graph.
  - [x] **Mutation**: Added random cross-links to spark innovation.

## 4. Known Issues & Todo
- [ ] Implement SeekDB Vector Search logic (Currently only Interface).
- [ ] Connect to real GitHub API.
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout optimization.

## 5. User Directives
- "Use the .ai-context.md file to track what I am doing right now."
- "Generate a summary report for every iteration."
- "Keep PRD/TDD/UI docs in sync with the code at all times."
